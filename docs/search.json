    "text": "Parameters\nOnly scores above a certain threshold of 5 are kept, as in practice scores of less than 5 do not correspond to true peaks. The score-generating function is a modified Z-score which considers the Z-score of the position with respect to both the (optionally normalized) upstream and downstream read-density distributions. It has several parameters: gap size (an integer), window size (an integer), percent trim (a float in the range [0, 1]), and winsorize (a boolean). We will explain each of these here and the possible effects that each can have on score-generation.\n\nGap Size:\n\nThe gap size is the distance upstream and downstream of the given genomic position to exclude from any distribution calculations.\nThis exclusion is important as peaks can often be distributed across many read positions, meaning that they can artificially inflate the estimation of the local distribution’s standard deviation, and may deflate the score we assign to true peaks, potentially leading to a higher false negative rate.\nThe default of the program is to set this value to 5.\n\n\n\nWindow Size:\n\nThe window size refers to the total number of reads to include in the distribution.\nThis number ought to be large enough to provide a useful estimate of the mean and standard deviation, but not so large as to cause it to include other genes or features which would further distort the gaussian assumption of those distributions.\nIn the program it defaults to 50.\n\n\n\nPercent Trim\n\nPercent trim is a value which aids in the turning of the upstream and downstream distributions before the mean and standard deviation are called.\nIt will remove the top x % of reads, based on their read density.\nThe default is 0, though the user can supply a different percentage, which in certain cases may be useful in removing extremely high values, such as peaks. S\nSetting a value greater than ~10% is not recommended however, as there are cases where a high percentage of trimming will allow other features, such as noise, or the shadows which can accompany peaks, to appear as peaks as well.\n\n\n\nWinsorize\n\nWinsorize serves a similar purpose as percent trim - although it facilitates the removal of reads based on standard deviation.\nFor a given window - any read which exceeds a standard deviation of 1.5 will be dropped.\nWe use a low standard deviation here, as it is important to remember extreme outliers can lead to a very large standard deviation.\nWe have found that a threshold for winsorization of 1.5 strikes a good balance between aiding in the elimination of true outliers (other peaks) while not appearing to disrupt regions without any extreme outliers."
