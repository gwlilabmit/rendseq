## End to End pipelining

Functions to go from alignment to peaks

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [bowtie_to_peak](bowtie_to_peak.qmd#rendseq.end_to_end.bowtie_to_peak) | Convert bowtie aligned file to peaks for 5r, 5f, 3r, and 3f. |
| [bowtie_to_peak_remove_shadows](bowtie_to_peak_remove_shadows.qmd#rendseq.end_to_end.bowtie_to_peak_remove_shadows) | Convert bowtie aligned file to peaks after shadow removal. |

## Peak Calling

Functions to call peaks from Rend-seq data.

| --- | --- |
| [hmm_peaks](hmm_peaks.qmd#rendseq.make_peaks.hmm_peaks) | Fit peaks to the provided z_scores data set using the vertibi algorithm. |
| [thresh_peaks](thresh_peaks.qmd#rendseq.make_peaks.thresh_peaks) | Find peaks by calling z-scores above a threshold as a peak. |
